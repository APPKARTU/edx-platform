# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should notify:
#   * @edx/ospr - to check licensing
#   * @edx/devops - to check system requirements


# This needs to be installed *after* lxml, which is in base.txt.
# python-saml pulls in lxml as a dependency, and due to a bug in setuptools,
# trying to compile lxml as a dependency causes setuptools to go into an
# infinite loop and run out of memory. Because why would you trust a
# dependency management tool to manage dependencies for you?
python-saml==2.1.6

# python-saml depends on lxml, which is referenced in base.txt. A bug exists
# in setuptools 18.0.1 which results in an infinite loop during
# resolution of this dependency during compilation. So we need to install
# python-saml only after lxml has been successfully installed. 

# In addition, we are currently utilizing a forked version of python-saml,
# managed by OpenCraft, which features enhanced logging and improved
# unicode support. We will return to the official version of python-saml
# on PyPI when these pull requests (or their derivatives) have been
# incorporated into the main project.
